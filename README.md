# 2-BIT_ALU_VHDL
Designed and simulated a 2-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL in Xilinx Vivado, implementing core arithmetic and logical operations including addition, subtraction, AND, and OR. The design follows a combinational architecture using a case statement and the IEEE NUMERIC_STD library for reliable arithmetic operations.
